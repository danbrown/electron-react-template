## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn electron-dev`

Runs the app in the development mode. Inside Electron.<br />
It opens a Electron App that loads the React application and auto updates on reaload.<br>

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) manually to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn electron-pack`

Builds the React app for production to the `build` folder. And the Electron distributions in `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
